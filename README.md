## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
This is a puppy adoption app, with the list of puppies to be adopted and the details of the chosen puppy.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
To let me discover the new user interface built with Jetpack, dial step by step.<br/>
But also to discover the new navigation which is very interesting.<br/>
It was quite simple thanks to the documentation https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose but also https://foso.github.io/Jetpack-Compose-Playground/.<br/>
With this application, I see a great future for Jetpack Compose which is great fun!
